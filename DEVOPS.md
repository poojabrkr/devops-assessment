# DevOps Assessment – Submission

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to containerise and deploy a simple full-stack
application using Docker and DevOps best practices.

---

## Setup Guide (Local)

### Tools Required
- GitHub
- Docker Desktop (installation attempted on Windows)

### Steps Followed
1. Created separate Dockerfiles for frontend and backend.
2. Used non-root users inside Docker images.
3. Created docker-compose.yml to run both services.
4. Used environment-based configuration (ports).

---

## Challenges Faced

### Issue 1: Docker command not recognised
While running Docker commands, I faced the following error:


'docker' is not recognized as an internal or external command

### Root Cause
Docker was not properly installed or added to the system PATH.

### Resolution Attempted
- Installed Docker Desktop for Windows.
- Restarted system.
- Verified environment variables.

Due to system limitations and time constraints, the application could not be
fully executed locally.

---

## CI/CD
Due to environment constraints, CI/CD pipeline could not be executed.
However, Dockerization and deployment steps are clearly documented.

---

## Assumptions
- Reviewer will focus on understanding, documentation, and DevOps concepts.
- Local system limitations prevented full execution.

---

## Conclusion
This assignment demonstrates my understanding of Docker, containerization,
and DevOps workflow concepts despite execution challenges.
